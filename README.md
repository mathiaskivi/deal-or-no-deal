# Deal or No Deal (DOND)
“Deal or No Deal” is a game. The aim of the game is to win as much money as possible, taking into account the offers from the banker. The banker's goal is to buy your suitcase as cheaply as possible. The banker makes bids on the basis of the remaining amounts, i.e. if larger amounts are lost, the banker lowers its own offer and vice versa.
